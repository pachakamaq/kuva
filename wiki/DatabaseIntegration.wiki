= Database integration =

In line with the goal of keeping the [core] module as simple and lightweight as possible, it will never use any database.  However, an extension to replace some of the XML files with database entries might be useful to developers with databases available.  This page is intended to elaborate on this idea.

Please note that [Extensions extension] authors are encouraged to not use generic names such as "database"; this way multiple extensions may accomplish the same task without any being labeled *the* extension for that task because of its name.
