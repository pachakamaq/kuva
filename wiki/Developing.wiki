= Developing Kuva =

Kuva is a very young project and therefore relatively easy to hack on.  However, please follow these guidelines in the interest of maintainability:
  * Keep the format of your code consistent with existing code.  So far this means:
    * Use Java-style curly brackets and indentation.
    * Indent four spaces for each level (and a tab is not equivalent to four spaces).
    * Include spaces around binary operators such as + - `*` / . && || & | and => but not property accessors :: and ->, round/curly/square brackets () {} `[]`, or unary operators like ! or - (the negative sign).  
  * Enclose PHP strings in single-quotes rather than double unless you intend PHP to subsitute variables into them.
  * Enclose XML and HTML attribute values in double-quotes.
  * Document variables and all functions with Javadoc-type comments, i.e.:
{{{
/**
 * void document(string $identifier, string $description)
 * 
 * Document your code!
 */
}}}
  * Additionally comment your code wherever it might be unclear, and notify fellow developers when this is necessary but they haven't done it.
