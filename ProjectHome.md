Kuva is a modular CMS designed for a small footprint in all resources, and no-nonsense content management.  "No-nonsense" here denotes low glitz and high power and flexibility, simply because no code is present to restrain you - the Linux of content-management systems.  (The name, [according to Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/#en|et|display), is Estonian, and Finnish for that matter, for the noun "display," as in a screen.)

It's even licensed the same as the Linux kernel, under GPLv2.  And one of the planned extensions will automatically apply that license by displaying the entire source of all non-restricted pages (the actual origin of the name, which now applies generically to to the CMS nature).  [phpsvnclient](http://code.google.com/p/phpsvnclient/) is being integrated and used to update the entire code base easily (and, if cron or another scheduler is available, you can make it automatic).
